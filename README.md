**Note**: If you need more papers, let me (Omid Reza Heidari) know, or if you have any other related papers, feel free to add to the list.

**Note**: There are tones of papers about this topic, and thus, it might be hard to propose a new algorithm. Personally speaking, a comprehensive review could be easier and more beneficial (It goes without saying that the final decision will be with three of you!).

# Trasient Noise Reduction with Neural Networks

This repository contains implementations of different deep learning models for transient noise reduction in audio signals. The models are applied to the [CSTR VCTK dataset](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443) to preprocess and enhance audio quality. The `.wav` files in the dataset are stored in the `wav48` folder inside subdirectories named `p225` to `p271`.

## Models

The following models are implemented in this repository:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - File: `CNN_F.ipynb`
   - A CNN-based approach to denoise audio signals by learning features from spectrograms.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**:
   - File: `NoiseReductionRNN_F.ipynb`
   - A recurrent model designed to capture temporal dependencies in audio signals for noise reduction.

3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**:
   - File: `MLP_F.ipynb`
   - A dense neural network used for learning mappings between noisy and clean audio features.


## Dataset

The models utilize the [CSTR VCTK dataset]([https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratt3000/vctk-corpus?select=VCTK-Corpus)) for training and evaluation. The dataset contains high-quality speech data with different accents, stored in `.wav` files under the `wav48` folder.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Download and extract the [CSTR VCTK dataset]([https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratt3000/vctk-corpus?select=VCTK-Corpus)).
   - Place the `wav48` folder in the root directory.
   - Place the noise Folder in the dataset.

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Each notebook (`CNN_F.ipynb`, `NoiseReductionRNN_F.ipynb`, `MLP_F.ipynb`) is self-contained and can be executed independently to train and evaluate the respective models.

3. **Add Transient Noise**:
   - To train models for transient noise reduction, augment the dataset with synthetic transient noise.

4. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Evaluate the models on clean and noisy audio files to analyze their performance.

## Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running the notebooks:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- NumPy
- Librosa
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work

- Fine-tune models for real-world noisy environments.
- Compare model performance on different types of transient noise.
- Explore hybrid models combining CNN, RNN, and MLP architectures.
